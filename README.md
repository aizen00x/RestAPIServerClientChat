# RestAPIServerClientChat
A fully functioning chat application server implementing REST API in a request-response architecture.
A user can log on to the web and open the chat application. On the homepage it displays the Login Screen where a user can 
enter their credentials which is then authenticated with a database in the cloud. After authentication, the user is directed 
to Chatroom Selection Page where the user can choose what chatroom they want to join. Upon selecting a chatroom, a chat page 
is displayed where user can interact with other users of the chatroom. There is also an auto-login feature that enables users
to automatically login without needing to entering credentials every time. New users can register using the register page. 
Registration button is available on the account login page.
